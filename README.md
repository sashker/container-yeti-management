# yeti-management in a container
#### Containerized version of yeti-management daemon (part of the "Yeti switch" project)
We are aimed at contenerization of yeti-management in order to provide an opportunity to run it
in Docker and other container services.

##Version notification
We follow the yeti-management versioning, so *master* image contains latest chages and might be unstable (though it's unlikely for yeti-management ;) )
and stable version has a tag as the main repo has.
